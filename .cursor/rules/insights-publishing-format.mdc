# Insights Publishing Rule

- Keep one reusable `category` per post; do not create one-off tags.
- Every insights card must include:
  - clickable category link to `/insights?category=<name>`
  - image with fallback placeholder emoji
  - title, short excerpt, and `Read insight` link
- Keep crawler metadata in `<meta>` and JSON-LD only; do not print meta description as main body copy on detail pages.
- Insight detail page must include:
  - favicon links
  - canonical URL
  - robots `index, follow`
  - `BlogPosting` schema
  - visible cover image with on-error fallback
- Use safe defaults when fields are missing:
  - `image`: `/avatar.svg`
  - `emoji`: `📝`
  - `category`: `Growth Strategy`
- Always preserve consistent visual hierarchy and spacing with existing site styles.
