## About Me

I’m Kamila Lipska, a full-stack growth architect with 15+ years of experience in SaaS, Web3, and digital ecosystems. I specialize in designing scalable marketing infrastructures that connect strategy with implementation, enabling high-velocity growth for companies navigating complexity, fragmentation, or rapid expansion.

From marketing data pipelines to automation architecture, attribution modeling to GTM strategy, I don’t just identify gaps, I build the systems that fix them for good. CEOs and CMOs trust me when they need a senior operator who can move fast, solve without hand-holding, and lead complex initiatives across brands, teams, or toolsets.

I’m EU-based, operate globally, and thrive in environments where autonomy, clarity, and strategic depth matter. My approach is grounded in analytics, driven by impact, and built for scale. I work remotely with American tech companies and founders who need someone they don’t have to micromanage.

My Approach

I architect growth systems that unify strategy with execution by blending precision, speed, and data integrity across the stack. My work goes beyond campaigns: I design self-sustaining infrastructures that turn fragmented tools and processes into revenue-aligned engines. From first-party data pipelines to lifecycle automation and performance funnels, everything I build is designed to remove guesswork, scale efficiently, and drive repeatable growth.

If it doesn’t generate impact or unlock leverage, it doesn’t belong in the system.

What Sets Me Apart

I’m a hybrid operator, strategic enough to architect the entire growth stack, technical enough to implement it without friction. My value lies in building order out of chaos: aligning data, automation, paid and organic, attribution, and CRM into one high-performing machine. While others need a team to make progress, I step in as a self-sufficient builder who can deliver outcomes from day one.

I don’t just optimize what’s broken, I design systems that don’t break.

## My Stack

This is a glimpse into the platforms I use to architect scalable growth systems. While these are some of the most recognized tools in analytics, automation, acquisition, and optimization, my real strength lies in how I connect them. I adapt to any stack, extend capabilities beyond defaults, and build solutions that align with your growth model — not just your toolset.

Hover to explore how I deploy each one to drive real business outcomes.

I use GA4 not just to track, but to diagnose, repair, and activate. From custom events to conversion modeling, I dig into user journeys, surface friction points, and translate data into business decisions.

I fix broken views, attribution issues, and reporting gaps so teams can finally trust what they’re seeing.

### GA4

Analytics & Intelligence

I use PostHog to map real user behavior and make sense of complex customer journeys. From event-based tracking to funnel breakdowns and cohort segmentation, I turn behavioral data into clear growth insights.

My implementations help uncover where users drop off, how they interact with key flows, and what patterns signal intent, all without relying on black-box analytics.

### PostHog

Analytics & Intelligence

I conduct comprehensive experience analysis through integrated heatmaps, scroll depth tracking, and qualitative user feedback collection to identify friction points and conversion opportunities. My approach includes segmenting user recordings by behavioral patterns, correlating survey responses with technical issues, and prioritizing UX improvements based on quantifiable impact assessment.

### Hotjar

Analytics & Intelligence

I use Segment to transform scattered, unreliable data into a clean, centralized source of truth. I design customer data pipelines that handle identity stitching, event enrichment, and payload transformation across the entire stack — making downstream tools smarter and more aligned.

My work ensures that product, marketing, and sales teams operate on real-time, trusted insights, not fragmented guesses.

### Segment

Data Infrastructure & Automation

I treat GTM like a control center, debugging broken tracking, customizing scripts, and ensuring nothing leaks or lags. I’ve deployed server-side GTM, fixed critical event mapping, and engineered setups that survive scaling, redesigns, and ad blockers.

Every tag I build serves a measurable purpose: enabling data you can act on, not just collect.

### Google Tag Manager

Data Infrastructure & Automation

I build no-code automation systems that eliminate human bottlenecks. Whether syncing leads, fixing webhook logic, or triggering custom CRM workflows, I turn Zapier and Make into robust infrastructure, not just quick fixes. My setups include error handling, conditional logic, and nested flows that run at scale.

These automations free up entire teams, reduce errors, and make growth operations sustainable.

### Zapier & Make

Data Infrastructure & Automation

I use Keitaro when teams need reliable attribution across paid channels. I fix misattributions, expose fraud, and validate performance with advanced logic. Whether tracking by campaign, device, or user journey, I make sure every insight is clean, accurate, and actionable.

It becomes the foundation for confident budget decisions and high-ROI media planning.

### Keitaro

Attribution & Visibility

I leverage GSC for in-depth search performance analysis, combining indexation diagnostics, structured data checks, and experience signals to improve rankings. I connect impression trends to conversion outcomes, exposing friction in search-to-site journeys.

GSC becomes a truth layer between what’s indexed, what ranks, and what drives business value.

### Search Console

Attribution & Visibility

I use Ahrefs to power technical SEO audits, keyword clustering, and competitive intelligence that drive sustainable search growth. My work identifies crawl inefficiencies, link opportunities, and semantic gaps that block visibility.

This turns SEO into a measurable acquisition engine, not a vague content checklist.

### Ahrefs

Attribution & Visibility

I run high-impact experimentation programs in VWO to validate what truly drives growth. From A/B tests to personalization campaigns, I build statistically sound frameworks that turn hypotheses into revenue insights.

My tests go beyond UI, they reshape funnels, touchpoints, and the way teams make decisions.

### VWO

Activation & Experimentation

I design intelligent, behavior-triggered email sequences with personalization logic to boost engagement, retention, and conversion. From onboarding flows to reactivation campaigns, I architect messaging systems that scale with your funnel.

These flows don’t just send emails, they move users through intentional, data-driven journeys.

### Brevo

Activation & Experimentation

I build high-performing, conversion-focused websites in Webflow with advanced interactions, clean CMS architecture, and full-stack SEO implementation. My builds integrate seamlessly with tracking systems and CRM workflows, combining speed, scale, and marketing precision.

Each site becomes a growth asset, not just a page, but a funnel with structure.

### Webflow

Organic Growth & Visibility

I build RevOps infrastructures inside HubSpot, aligning marketing, sales, and automation into one efficient system. My implementations cover lead scoring, workflow automation, reporting, and bidirectional syncs that power real-time activation.

I turn HubSpot from a CRM into a command center for predictable pipeline growth.

### Hubspot

Growth Ops

I create centralized knowledge management systems with interconnected databases, automated I architect knowledge systems in Notion that scale with teams, from operations dashboards to collaborative documentation flows. My setups replace fragmented SOPs with connected, automated workspaces that accelerate execution.

It becomes more than documentation, it’s the operational backbone of how teams grow.

### Notion

Growth Ops

I use front-end code not for design experiments, but to control data quality, track accuracy, and UX performance. From micro-interactions to custom tracking events, I implement with semantic precision and scalability in mind.

This lets me bridge the gap between product, marketing, and data, without waiting on engineering.

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Growth Ops

I architect high-performance search campaigns with smart bidding logic, granular audience layers, and conversion-verified tracking. I continuously refine structures and align creative with commercial intent, maximizing ROAS while maintaining positioning.

These aren’t just campaigns, they’re profit centers built on strategic intent and measurable ROI.

### SEM

Acquisition Channels

I develop advanced paid social ecosystems across Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, and X, combining audience intelligence, funnel segmentation, and creative experimentation. I implement custom attribution setups and optimize across platforms for engagement, cost efficiency, and conversion.

Every ad set I build is part of a bigger system, one that’s accountable to business metrics, not just engagement rates.

### Social Paid Ads

Acquisition Channels

I manage performance campaigns across crypto-native and niche ad networks like Brave, Coinzilla, Taboola, and direct media buys. I implement anti-fraud protocols, optimize creatives for vertical specificity, and track impact through tailored attribution models.

These placements unlock underutilized channels with high buying intent, built to scale beyond mainstream networks.

### Alternative Ads

Acquisition Channels

## Growth Systems I Build

I design and implement high-leverage systems that make growth scalable, measurable, and self-sustaining. These aren’t isolated services, they’re interconnected infrastructures that align data, automation, and acquisition with your business model. Whether you’re fixing what’s broken or building from scratch, I create systems that drive revenue, not vanity metrics.

### 01

### Advanced Tracking & Data Infrastructure

I architect full-funnel tracking systems that give you clean, real-time visibility into performance, attribution, and revenue outcomes. From server-side pipelines to multi-touch models, I eliminate data blind spots and fix attribution at the source, ensuring every growth decision is based on truth, not assumptions.

▶ Landing page & conversion tracking alignment – Ensuring ad campaigns connect cleanly to tracking infrastructure and post-click flows, so every result can be measured and improved.

I build lifecycle systems that combine CRM logic, marketing automation, and sales enablement into one seamless growth engine. My work transforms scattered tools and workflows into fully integrated systems that react to user behavior, personalize experiences at scale, and accelerate pipeline velocity. From lead scoring to triggered journeys, I ensure automation serves revenue, not just engagement.

Core System Components:

▶ HubSpot , Customer.io & Zapier integrations – Building end-to-end automation for lead capture, nurture, and handoff across marketing and sales workflows.

▶ Behavior - based automation – Triggering campaigns, CRM actions, or audience segmentation based on actual user behavior, not static rules.

▶ Lead scoring & segmentation – Designing scoring logic and audience rules to prioritize high-fit leads and route them into the right lifecycle path.

I design conversion systems that turn behavioral data into growth levers, combining experimentation, analytics, and journey-level insight to drive measurable improvements across key funnels. From A/B testing infrastructure to form optimization and session diagnostics, I don’t guess what works, I validate, refine, and scale it.

Core System Components:

▶ A/B testing & performance experiments – Running structured tests via VWO, PostHog, or Google Optimize to validate hypotheses and quantify improvements across UX and funnel flows.

▶ Heatmaps , scroll tracking & session recordings –Using tools like Hotjar and PostHog to identify drop-off points, friction zones, and lost intent across devices and journeys.

▶ Form & checkout process optimization – Streamlining interactions and reducing abandonment by optimizing copy, field logic, micro-interactions, and performance barriers.

I build lead systems that don’t just capture, they convert. From gated content to multi-touch nurture flows, I connect every funnel stage to revenue by aligning strategy, tracking, and experience. My approach turns disjointed forms and fragmented lead flows into streamlined, CRM-aligned engines that drive pipeline velocity and scale predictably.

Core System Components:

▶ Lead magnet campaigns & inbound funnels –Designing high-converting gated content and opt-in strategies that align with user intent and sales goals.

▶ CRM - integrated lead tracking – Mapping journeys from first touch to close with attribution-safe data flows between front-end capture and back-end CRM systems.

▶ Funnel analytics & performance tuning – Auditing each stage of the funnel to surface drop-offs, test improvements, and unlock hidden conversion opportunities.

I build and optimize websites that do more than look good, they perform. From SEO-ready site architecture to analytics-integrated forms and conversion-tuned UX, I ensure every element is aligned with growth. Whether it’s Webflow, WordPress, or a hybrid tech stack, I turn your website into a scalable, trackable, lead-generating machine.

Core System Components:

▶ Webflow & WordPress optimizations – Improving performance, crawlability, and UX structure with technical SEO, clean CMS logic, and fast-loading assets.

▶ Advanced tracking & automation setups – Implementing precise event tracking and native integrations that tie user actions to marketing workflows and analytics.

▶ Conversion - driven UX improvements – Refining navigation, CTAs, and lead capture touchpoints to increase flow efficiency and reduce friction.

I design acquisition systems built for the complexity of Web3, aligning paid channels, search intent, onboarding, and developer traction into compliant, performance-driven funnels. Whether it’s driving token adoption or structuring user journeys across L2s, dApps, or security ecosystems, I architect growth programs that are measurable, scalable, and made for technical audiences.

Core System Components:

▶ Crypto-native ad networks & paid acquisition – Performance-focused campaigns across Brave, Coinzilla, TradingView, and blockchain-native platforms, with advanced tracking and fraud prevention built in.

▶ SEO & content for Web3 projects – Ranking for developer-intent, protocol-specific, and industry-trusted search terms using structured content architecture and entity-based optimization.

▶ Developer & user acquisition strategies – Building adoption flows across onboarding, docs, lead capture, and retention, tailored to technical personas and product lifecycles.

I build analytics systems that surface what truly matters, performance clarity, revenue attribution, and forward-looking growth signals. My work connects fragmented data across tools, devices, and campaigns into one source of truth for decision-makers. Whether it’s predictive modeling, advanced attribution, or automated reporting, I make data trustworthy and business-relevant.

Core System Components:

▶ Automated data pipelines – Connecting GA4, PostHog, Keitaro, and custom BI tools into clean, query-ready datasets for unified reporting.

▶ Cross - device tracking & advanced attribution – Revealing the true impact of marketing and product actions across journeys, touchpoints, and platforms.

▶ Automated reporting & business intelligence – Building dashboards and alert systems that give leadership visibility into what’s working, what’s stalling, and where to double down.

I build retention engines that go beyond email drips and dashboard nudges, combining behavioral insight, user flow optimization, and lifecycle automation to drive long-term engagement and revenue expansion. My approach helps product, growth, and data teams unify around one goal: turning users into power users.

Core System Components:

▶ Product analytics & user behavior insights – Using PostHog, GA4, and cohort analysis to uncover drop-off patterns, aha moments, and growth levers inside the product.

▶ Retention - focused lifecycle automation – Designing post-signup workflows, re-engagement sequences, and in-product triggers to improve activation and reduce churn.

▶ Experimentation & user journey optimization – Testing onboarding flows, conversion paths, and engagement loops to increase value delivery and habit formation.

I don’t just strategize — I execute, optimize, and scale systems that drive real business outcomes. From data infrastructure to acquisition to lifecycle automation, I bring structure to chaos, clarity to metrics, and performance to every growth layer. My approach eliminates guesswork and transforms marketing from a cost center into a scalable, revenue-aligned engine.

Core System Principles:

▶ Full - stack growth systems – Connecting strategy to execution across data, paid media, automation, content, and analytics.

▶ Scaling high - performance marketing operations – Removing friction, fixing inefficiencies, and building repeatable systems that scale with the business.

▶ Focused on measurable revenue outcomes – Making sure every action drives pipeline, retention, or expansion, not just traffic or vanity KPIs.
